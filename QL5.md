# Using the QL5

You can find the QL5 Manual [here](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/proaudio/mixers/ql_series/downloads.html#d684403). You should read it!

## Tips

- **Detailed controls page: Tap on-screen knobs twice**.

  Many controls (particularly in the channel strip view) have a more detailed screen hiding behind them. A _slow_ double-tap will open the detailed screen and show you many more options.

- **Fine adjustments: Hold down the physical knob while turning**.

  If you need to adjust a parameter more finely than the detented knob allows, turning it _while pushing it in_ will allow you to adjust more finely.

- **Stereo linking: Hold down any two channel select buttons**.

  This will open the channel link screen. Now hold the select button of one channel you want to link, and while holding it press 1 or more other select buttons to link them together. They don't need to be sequential.

- **Don't forget channel jobs!**

  Pressing the `CH JOB` button allows you to do bulk actions to multiple channels.

- **Beware the HELP button**.

  Pressing the Help button in the top-right of the screen will load the entire manual on-screen. It takes up to a minute to load, and you can't cancel it once it's loading. You will be locked out of the screen for this entire duration.

## Navigating with User-Defined Keys (UDKs)

Some features/pages are more easily accessed using user-defined hard keys to the right of the screen.

### Common UDK Uses

1. **Use `UDK 1` as a universal "Home" button**. No matter what menu you're in, this will return you to the default screen state.

1. **Set faders and knobs to Unity/0dB**. Hold `UDK 9`, and while holding press any channel select button or tap an on-screen knob. Doing so will set the channel fader (or on-screen knob) to 0dB.

1. **Use alternate functions**. Pressing `UDK 6` will enable all "alternate functions" on screen. Most commonly, **you can use this to adjust the digital trim instead of the analog gain.**

1. **Add your own bookmarks**. Buttons 3, 4, and 5 are unset bookmarks. If you have an on-screen page you visit frequently, open it and then hold down the UDK you'd like to assign it to.

### Default UDK assignments

The base template includes a number of preset UDKs:

| #   | Action                   |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | Selected Channel View    |
| 2   | 8-channel Overview       |
| 3   | _unused bookmark_        |
| 4   | _unused bookmark_        |
|     |                          |
| 5   | _unused bookmark_        |
| 6   | Alternate Function       |
| 7   | User-Defined Key Config  |
| 8   | Custom Fader Bank Config |
|     |                          |
| 9   | Set to 0dB               |
| 10  | Set to default value     |
| 11  | Previous UDK bank        |
| 12  | Next UDK bank            |

If you only remember one, remember **`UDK 7`**, which will show you this list on screen.

## Mounting Devices

Dante is a protocol for running audio signal between devices on the network. **However, Dante does not pass any control messages between devices.** If you'd just like to pass audio to/from the QL5, **you do not need to mount the device.**

If you need to control the device, here's how to mount it.

### Mounting a Device

1. **Go to the Device Mount page** by pressing `SETUP` > `DANTE SETUP` > `DEVICE MOUNT`.

1. **Find an open slot.** In the Device Mount page, select any slot that doesn't have a device.

1. Choose your device from the **Online Devices** list.

1. **Wait** for up to a minute. You can try to press the refresh button in the device mount screen, but generally you just have to be patient.
