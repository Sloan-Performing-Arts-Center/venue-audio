# Sloan Dance Rep - Audio/Video System

The Sloan Dance Repertory Plot is our proscenium-like setup used for dance department performances and various other events. During most academic semesters, this plot remains in the space for a sequence of multiple shows. It features the standard west-facing audience on fully-extended risers, and a standard soft-goods package of 6 legs, an upstage traveler, and an upstage cyc with projection capability.
